Write the script which takes infinitive verbs separated by one space as the command line arguments and displays their present participle form in separated lines.

    A simple set of heuristic rules can be given as follows:
    If the verb ends in e, drop the e and add -ing (if not exception: be, see, flee, knee, etc.)
    If the verb ends in ie, replace ie with y and add -ing
    For words consisting of consonant-vowel-consonant, double the final letter before adding -ing
    By default just add -ing
